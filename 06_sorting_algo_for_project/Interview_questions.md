# 🔹 Core Definitions (*important questions*)

## **What Does In-Place Mean? (Interview Answer)**
“In-place means the algorithm does not need extra memory proportional to the input size.  
It performs all operations inside the original array using only a small constant amount of extra space — like a few variables, pointers, or indices.  
Because it does not create large extra data structures, an in-place algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) or sometimes O(log n) due to recursion.”

## **What Does Stable Mean in Sorting? (Interview Answer)**
“A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements.  
If two elements have the same value in the input, they should appear in the same order in the output.”

# 🔹 Interview Questions – Structured

## ⭐ 1. Which sorting algorithm is the best among Quick, Merge, Heap, and Bubble Sort? Why?
Quick Sort is generally the fastest in practice because of good cache performance and average O(n log n) time.  
Merge Sort is best when stability is required.  
Heap Sort guarantees O(n log n) even in the worst case, while Bubble Sort is the slowest and mostly used for teaching.

---

## ⭐ 2. Why is Quick Sort faster than Merge Sort in practice?
Quick Sort uses in-place partitioning and has excellent cache locality, so data remains in CPU cache more often.  
Merge Sort requires extra memory and moves more data around, which slows it down in real scenarios.

---

## ⭐ 3. If Quick Sort is so fast, why does it have a worst-case time complexity of O(n²)?
When the pivot is chosen poorly (like first or last element in a sorted array), Quick Sort produces highly unbalanced partitions, causing a recursion depth of n and degrading to O(n²).

---

## ⭐ 4. Why do we use Merge Sort for linked lists but not Quick Sort?
Merge Sort works efficiently with linked lists because splitting and merging do not require random access.  
Quick Sort needs random index access (arr[i], arr[j]) which is slow on linked lists.

---

## ⭐ 5. Why is Merge Sort stable but Heap Sort and Quick Sort are not?
Merge Sort compares and merges elements sequentially without changing relative order of equal elements.  
Quick Sort and Heap Sort use swapping across distant positions, which can reorder equal values.

---

## ⭐ 6. Which sorting algorithm should you use for very large datasets?
Merge Sort — because it gives consistent O(n log n) time and works well for external sorting (file-based sorting), plus predictable performance.

---

## ⭐ 7. Which algorithm should you choose when memory is limited?
Quick Sort → average O(n log n) with O(log n) space  
Heap Sort → worst-case O(n log n) with O(1) space  
Both work well in memory-constrained environments.

---

## ⭐ 8. Why is Bubble Sort rarely used in production?
It has O(n²) time complexity in worst and average cases, making it slow and inefficient for large inputs.  
It’s mainly used for teaching basic algorithm concepts.

---

## ⭐ 9. Why is Heap Sort not stable even though it gives O(n log n)?
Heap Sort performs swaps between root and last element repeatedly.  
These swaps can change the order of equal elements, making it unstable.

---

## ⭐ 10. Why does Merge Sort require O(n) extra space?
Merge Sort needs temporary arrays during merging.  
It cannot perform merging in-place without breaking stability or increasing complexity.

---

## ⭐ 11. When should you prefer Heap Sort over Quick Sort?
You should prefer Heap Sort when you must guarantee O(n log n) even in the worst case, such as in real-time systems or applications where worst-case performance matters.

---

## ⭐ 12. Why is Quick Sort preferred in competitive programming?
Quick Sort is fast, in-place, and works very well for random data.  
Its average performance is excellent.  
Also, most languages implement Quick Sort or variations (like IntroSort) internally.

---

## ⭐ 13. Why is Quick Sort considered “cache-friendly”?
It accesses elements contiguous in memory during partitioning, which loads fewer cache lines and speeds up data operations.  
Merge Sort jumps around memory more.

---

## ⭐ 14. Can Merge Sort be implemented in-place?
Not easily.  
In-place Merge Sort is possible but extremely complex and slow in practice.  
The classic Merge Sort uses O(n) space.

---

## ⭐ 15. Why does Heap Sort destroy the heap structure?
Because after every extraction of the root (maximum element), heap size reduces and heapify is applied again.  
This continuously modifies and rebuilds the heap.
